# Keyboard Warriors Sprint 0 Reflection Report
Project: Express Towing App
<br>
Team Members: Michael Romero, Jorge Sandoval Ruiz, Andres Ojeda, Saiyam Bhakta, Ibrahim Chaudhry

## Accomplished Tasks
### Michael
I was able to share some of the mock up UI designs for the Express users, which I was able to create using Figma that was easily shareable so that the rest of the team can gain access and start designing as well.

### Jorge
During sprint 0, I helped in the set up of the Trello board by editing some of the lists, and added items to the backlog. I collaborated with the ideas for the tech stack of the project, and features that were added to the backlog. I also contributed to the decision to split the app into two parts, so that clients would see their own options while businesses and drivers would access their dedicated side of the application. I helped in the review and editing of the product requirements document.

### Andres
During Sprint 0, I helped with the creation of the requirements document, mainly with the investigation and identification of the tech stack, while mentioning and explaining key features that the application would need for its proper functioning. I helped with the planification of the main app structure (driver/user/company) and proposed multiple alternatives that may be used for driver/admin frontend of the application.

### Saiyam
In Sprint 0, I helped write the user profile, as well as some of the functional and nonfunctional requirements we plan to implement in our project. In the user profile, I described the intentions for our app according to our sponsor, as well as the targeted demographic for the services. I introduced some features that our app might need like app specific features/services that customers can request, as well as methods for admins to check progress of each service. I additionally came up with a list of questions for our group to ask the sponsor to gain a clearer vision for the app. 

### Ibrahim
During Sprint 0, I created and shared the initial project schedule draft in Trello, and set up the GitHub organization and repository, adding all team members as collaborators. I also drafted and shared the outline for the requirements document, where I made contributions to the problem statement, system requirements/tech stack, and feature list sections. Additionally, I wrote several user stories covering the service request flow, registration, and user interaction. I contributed to the non-functional requirements section and participated in the sponsor call with my teammates, where I helped clarify the sponsor’s vision for the app. I created and shared the outline for the design document and made a very small amount of progress on the class diagram. I am satisfied with my contributions during this Sprint.

## How AI Was Used
ChatGPT was used for the following purposes:
* Ibrahim – Brainstorming questions to ask the sponsor prior to our meeting with him
* Ibrahim – Brainstorming potential technologies for the tech stack in the requirements doc
* Ibrahim – Revising the wording for the problem statement in the requirements doc
* Ibrahim – Revising the wording for the feature list and the user stories I wrote
* Ibrahim – Revising the wording for the non-functional requirements I wrote
* Saiyam – Formatting functional and nonfunctional requirements
* Saiyam – Adding potential features that might be implemented in the app

## What Went Well
We had a successful meeting with the sponsor, going over more of the business side of towing, getting a better in-depth understanding of how towing is actually done, and the process from getting a service call, as well as the actual execution of the dispatcher sending out the driver to the location of the tow. We also got a better understanding of the vision he sees for the app when it comes to the functionality and the basic features that are a high priority for implementation. Each member made significant contributions to the requirements document and the progress of the project overall.

## What Could Be Improved
Although we have been completing our tasks on time, in the future, we could communicate about responsibilities and tasks earlier in the sprint to work more throughout the sprint rather than completing most tasks towards the end of the sprint. For future sprints, we could communicate more often and be more proactive in getting our tasks done.

## Focus of Next Sprint
One of the main focuses for the next sprint is to start working on designs for the Express app for the drivers, to start brainstorming the driver's functionality path, and maybe create a user flow diagram to help show the complete path a user takes to navigate through the features to complete a task. We also need to draft all the diagrams listed in the design doc: a class diagram, an ER diagram, an information architecture diagram, and the user interface wireframes. Additionally, we could add the documentation for each sprint to the GitHub repository going forward to help track our progress.
